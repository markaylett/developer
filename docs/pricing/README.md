# Pricing

We offer a simple pricing model that reflects the amount of data that we publish to your account.
There is a small monthly fee, which is determined by your chosen plan, that includes a generous
amount of data bandwidth. See our [website](https://reactivemarkets.com) for full details on
[pricing plans](https://reactivemarkets.com/pricing)

Your data usage is updated every minute and can be viewed in the platform UI. As you get close to
your limit you will receive notifications in the UI to ensure that you have plenty of notice. Data
limits for an account can then be topped up manually at any time or automatically when you reach
your limit.

When using the platform API you have a lot of control over the amount of data you receive by
subscribing to order book with different update frequencies and depths. For example, a 5 level
snapshot is significantly smaller than a 10 level snapshot and 1 second updates consume half the
data than 500 millisecond updates.
